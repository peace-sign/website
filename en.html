    <h2>What's happening?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, in modern Russia, in practice, a legislative ban has been introduced on the expression of one's
      own opinion and civil position, if it diverges from the general line of the Kremlin. People who went to
      unauthorized rallies are arrested. And to organize a sanctioned rally is, again, practically impossible. But even
      if you act strictly within this quasi-legal field, you can still be arrested and brought to administrative or
      criminal liability. We are being shut up. There is no dialogue between the society and the authorities. But the
      moment has come when it is no longer possible to be silent. A war has been unleashed between the fraternal peoples
      - Russian and Ukrainian. Any sane person does not want to believe in this even now, when it has become a fait
      accompli. We, those who do not succumb to the massive propaganda of the Kremlin, the citizens of Russia, real, not
      plywood, patriots, we believe that Putin is personally responsible for what happened. He himself does not hide
      this, and literally stated that it was HE who made the decision and ordered the invasion, in his recent address to
      the Russians. This time, no one held any referendums or general votes. One can argue for a long time about whether
      this step was forced. Some believe that there was no choice. This is not true. Negotiating is the main job of
      politicians. It is at the negotiating table that all controversial issues should be resolved. Sometimes, you
      should moderate your ambitions and be able to compromise. The unleashed war is evidence of incompetence. War -
      there can be no justification.</p>

    <h2>What can I do?</h2>
    <p>First of all, we need to show the Ukrainians, the whole world, and also, each other, that we are in solidarity in
      our attitude to this monstrous war. We need to show that we are many. Unfortunately, many Russian Internet sites
      are currently undergoing strict moderation and the voices of those who oppose the war are being silenced under
      pressure from pro-Kremlin forces. Moreover, we face a real risk of disconnecting the Russian segment of the
      Internet from the rest of the world. What until recently we laughed at and wittily ironized - is becoming a harsh
      reality. Nevertheless, we just need the opportunity to give signals to each other, to indicate our position in the
      ongoing madness. At the moment, we suggest using a special sign for this - pacific, peace sign - ‚òÆ. The time has
      come to dust off this artifact of world history and take it back into service, as many anti-war movements have
      done in the past. This sign is understandable to many without translation and additional explanations. This symbol
      is present in many fonts and in the emoji set. This sign is easy to draw by hand on any surface. This sign can be
      used on your avatars in social networks, on any discussion platforms. This sign can be superimposed on images on
      sites, even if their subject matter is in no way related to politics. This sign will help us unite. This symbol is

    <h2>is that enough?</h2>
    <p>Of course not. This is just the beginning of the action. We need to form an anti-war movement, which, perhaps,
      will be able to influence something or give hope for real changes, to rally people in front of a common disaster.
